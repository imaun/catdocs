# Catdocs
## Maintain OpenAPI documentations with ease
Welcome to **Catdocs**! This repository contains tools, libraries, and a CLI for managing OpenAPI documentation, specifically designed for teams working collaboratively on APIs.

## Introduction

Catdocs is an OpenAPI documentation tool that streamlines the process of managing API documentation for teams. By enabling the splitting of OpenAPI documents, Catdocs allows different teams or individuals to work on separate parts of the API documentation, ensuring efficient and organized collaboration.

## Features

- **OpenAPI Documentation Management**: Easily handle large OpenAPI documents by splitting them into manageable parts.
- **Team Collaboration**: Supports collaborative work by allowing different team members to edit specific sections of the API documentation.
- **External Reference Handling**: Automatically resolves and manages external references in OpenAPI documents.
- **CLI Tool**: Includes a command-line interface for easy integration into your workflow.
- **Validation**: Validates OpenAPI documents to catch errors before publishing.
- **Version Control Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Git for version control, enabling team members to push and pull changes effortlessly.

## Benefits

- **Scalability**: Manage large and complex OpenAPI documents by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Team Efficiency**: Improve team efficiency by allowing members to focus on their specific areas of responsibility.
- **Error Reduction**: Reduce errors by validating OpenAPI documents before publishing.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrate Catdocs into your existing workflow with ease, thanks to its CLI and version control capabilities.

## How It Works

1. **Splitting Documentation**: Catdocs splits your main OpenAPI document into multiple files, each representing different parts of the API (e.g., paths, responses, schemas).
2. **Editing Parts Independently**: Team members can work on their assigned parts independently, using their preferred tools.
3. **Merging Changes**: Catdocs merges the individual parts back into a single cohesive OpenAPI document, resolving any references.
4. **Validation**: Before finalizing the documentation, Catdocs validates the OpenAPI document to ensure there are no errors.
5. **Version Control**: Use Git to manage changes, enabling team collaboration and maintaining a history of modifications.
